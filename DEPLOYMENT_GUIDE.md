## Expected Discord Message Format

When someone submits the contact form, you'll receive a Discord message like this:

```
ðŸŽ« New Contact Form Submission

ðŸ‘¤ Name: John Doe
ðŸ“§ Email: john@example.com
ðŸ“‹ Subject: Technical Support
ðŸ’° Plan Interest: Pro - $0.35/month
ðŸ’¬ Message: I need help setting up my Discord bot...

VisiHost Contact Form â€¢ Today at 2:30 PM
```

## Troubleshooting

### Contact Form Not Working?

1. **Check Environment Variable**
   - Make sure `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` is set correctly
   - Redeploy after adding the variable

2. **Check Browser Console**
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Look for any JavaScript errors
   - Check Network tab for failed requests

3. **Test Discord Webhook**
   - You can test the webhook directly using curl:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1373641959981322270/UK_sZ07biG8sI3_a85q-V8ArMLGt-5kEPCW5M_icgnSr7Ui1z8Vsxh4r5Bjg4iEarYKj" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"content": "Test message from VisiHost website!"}'
   ```

### Common Issues

1. **Functions Not Working**
   - Make sure `netlify/functions/` folder structure is correct
   - Check that `netlify.toml` is in the root directory

2. **CORS Errors**
   - The function includes CORS headers, but if you see errors, try redeploying

3. **Form Validation Errors**
   - Make sure all required fields are filled
   - Check email format is valid

## Custom Domain Setup (Optional)

1. **Add Custom Domain**
   - Go to Site settings â†’ Domain management
   - Add your custom domain
   - Follow DNS configuration instructions

2. **SSL Certificate**
   - Netlify automatically provides SSL certificates
   - Your site will be available at `https://yourdomain.com`

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the Netlify function logs in your dashboard
2. Test the Discord webhook URL directly
3. Ensure all files are uploaded correctly
4. Contact support via Discord: https://discord.gg/Vd48FAZCGV
